# WHMCS-Product-Limiter

WHMCS Product Limiter is a free addon module that gives you the ability to limit purchasing a product to specified times (adjustable).

When activated, once the client will try to purchase the same product again – he will receive an error message (customizable)

That can be handy when giving free trial versions.
